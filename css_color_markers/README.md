# css_color_markers

Project 3 in FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

A web page with three markers that are red, green and blue.
This project taught me about rgb colors in css and hexadecimal codes for colors.
I also learned some more style rules in css, like rgba, hsl, and box-shadow

Best,
