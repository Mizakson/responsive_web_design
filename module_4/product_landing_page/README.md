# product_landing_page

Project 17 in FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification

In this project I made a product landing page for Eco-Friendly Bucket Hats.

I learned more about the structure of a webpage, formatting a webpage (using a nav tag).

I also used a different font, and used section tags to break up my project into chunks.

This project passed the required tests to move on in the certification.

Best,
