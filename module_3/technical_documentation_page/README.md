# technical_documentation_page

Project 14 in FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification

In this project, I created a technical documentation page.

This project passed the required tests to move on in the certification.

I learned more about linking elements using href statements and adding text fragments.

For example <a class="menu_link" href="#home">Home</a>

This example would go to the homepage after clicking the link on the text "Home".
