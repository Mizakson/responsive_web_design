# balance_sheet

Project 12 in the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate.

In this project, I learned more about css selectors. Specifically the difference between id selectors and class selectors.
I also learned more about the importance of a z-index when layering shapes or images, and the position of the items.

Best,
