# cat_photo_app

Project 1 in FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.
A webpage that lets you submit a photo of a cat, and fill out a form about your cat.
The page also has a list of things cats like and dislike. This project taught me the basics
of structuring a webpage and html elements.

Best,
